JSS Change Log

0.6

* Adds support for css triggers, this allows you to provide a JS callback for a CSS selector, a simple use case would be to provide rounded corners to IE. [Thanks go to Angelo Berios for this idea]
* support for a custom list of rel tags , this is mostly useful to stop JSS from snooping in rel="styleshet" includes
* minor performance tweaks
* Added experimental support for live page updates using the livequery plugin

0.5

* Added support for the 'rel' attribute. JSS will now only load linked styles if all the following conditions are met:
- rel="stylesheet" or rel="jss-stylesheet" is set on the link element.
- type="text/css" is set on the link element.
- loadExternalStyles is set to true.
* Added rel="jss-stylesheet" so a separate JSS stylesheet can be served up without browser parsing. This can be helpful if a browser is choking on certain selectors.
* Added @JSS css comments support: this can be helpful if you have selectors that are not valid CSS selectors such as 'input:submit' these may choke the browsers css engine so we can easily mask them by wrapping them in comment which begins with @JSS. here is an example:
/*@JSS input:submit { background:red; } */


0.4

* Parse order of external stylesheets could be incorrect due to the nature of AJAX calls, there is now a load queue so stylesheets get parsed in source order rather than load order. [Thanks to Daniel Wachsstock <d.wachss@prodigy.net> for reporting this]
* We now skip applying a selector if the browser already understands it. This avoids cluttering the DOM with style information when it isn't needed. [Thanks to Daniel Wachsstock <d.wachss@prodigy.net> for all his help with this]
* Added support for media types so stylesheets with a media type set are only applied if the media type is in effect. [Thanks again to Daniel Wachsstock <d.wachss@prodigy.net> for a bunch of the logic]
* Added the $.jss.checkMediaTypes flag to enable/disable the media types support. Please disable it if you get issues, particularly in Safari 3.
* Added better external stylesheet debugging.


0.3

* fixed IE support for parsing internal <style> tags.
* wrapped plugin in a closure to avoid conflicts.
* Now using jQuery.trim() so we can remove String.prototype which is ugly.
* A minor speed improvement.


0.2

* Added support for $.jss.only to filter only a subset of selectors.
* Major improvements to selector caching.
* Added some better default exclusions to exclude :hover and simple selectors.
* Fixed support for IE6 and Opera (except when in debug mode).
* Package now includes a basic speed test.


0.1

* Initial release.
